# Am I Late? - Smart Alarm Application

## Overview

**Am I Late?** is a personal project for a **smart alarm application**.  
The idea is simple: by monitoring traffic and your planned destinations, the app can tell you if you might be late and suggest the best time to leave.

Currently, this repository contains the **backend**, which provides APIs to manage:

- Users
- Destinations
- Alarms

The backend is built with Go and PostgreSQL, designed to be clean and easy to extend.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a base for a smart alarm system that can eventually be used by a mobile application to provide real-time notifications and intelligent departure suggestions.
